# The open source karaoke code of conduct
This is a guide to make sure karaoke-goers have the best time possible. Karaoke rooms should be safe and inclusive spaces to sing your hearts out (or watch others do so, if that's more your style).



## Required conduct
- **Respect the space.** It’s just the right thing to do. Don’t get your crew kicked out, and be nice to the onsite staff that makes karaoke possible.
- **Treat slurs with caution.** If you’re not from the group the word is referring to, don’t use it. If you’re not sure about a word, just don’t say it. You can either skip (preferred) or replace (also acceptable but less preferred) the word. This ensures that marginalized people in the room will feel safe and comfortable.
- **Look up the lyrics first.** There’s a huge difference between enjoying a song by yourself and repeating its lyrics in front of your karaoke crew.
- **Know when to stop.** Have you sang several songs in a row? Share the mic. Was that your third drink? Don't order a fourth. Karaoke is about fun. For everyone.
- **Use good judgement when it comes to song choices.** Every karaoke crew has their own preferences regarding acceptable musical styles, artists, subjects, and SFW/NSFW levels. Make sure you agree on your limits together: for example, many karaoke-goers prefer not to sing songs by controversial artists.
- **Check with the room before skipping a song** Don't skip stuff without asking, especially near the end. The point of karaoke is to be happy. This makes people sad.


## Tips to make karaoke more fun for everyone

- **Prepare your playlist in advance.** Save yourself a little time and think about your first few songs before you get into the room. It's okay to skip songs if you're not happy with the results, and it’s wonderful to get inspired to add new songs as the night goes on. However, every second counts in karaoke, especially at the beginning.
- **Avoid songs with intros over 30 seconds long.** I can't wait to sing… wait… wait… …….. well, this is awkward. This suggestion does not apply if the group is small and people need time to input more songs.
- **Avoid songs that include multiple 30+-second parts without singing.** Guitar solos are great, but also boring for most people. This suggestion does not apply if the group is small and people need time to input more songs.
- **Observe and empathize.** Does someone seem like they want to join in? Encourage them to be part of the crowd. Is someone not feeling great? Check in on them. Is someone being excluded by the deep cuts on your karaoke room tracklist? Pick some well-known songs so they can sing, too.
- **Sing together.** Karaoke isn’t about being polished—it’s about being silly. If someone wants to sing with you, let them. See someone singing along? Give them an available mic (or share your own).
